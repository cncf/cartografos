## The Cartografos Working Group

 The Cartografos working group aims to provide tools to help adopters and end-users to navigate the CNCF landscape and the wider cloud native ecosystem.

We want to educate and inform users with effective and practical guidance to help them understand the cloud native ecosystem. We do this by collaborating with groups inside and outside the CNCF.

We work to engage with CNCF projects at sandbox, incubating, and graduated level to ensure effective and accurate representation within assets, as well as CNCF Technical Advisory Groups. We also provide a vendor neutral forum for validation, discussion and feedback.

Areas in scope of the working group are CNCF non-code assets such as the CNCF Landscape, the Trail Map, as well as a maturity model and landscape guide - the last two under development. Additionally any other assets that help cloud native technology adopters navigate the various CNCF and cloud native community projects.

Currently assets under development:

* The Cloud Native Maturity Model
* The CNCF Landscape Guide, in association with the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee.
