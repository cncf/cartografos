# The Cartografos Working Group

The cloud native landscape and ecosystem is evolving quickly. The Cartografos working group aims to provide tools to help adopters and end-users to navigate the CNCF landscape and the wider cloud native ecosystem.

We want to educate and inform users with effective and practical guidance to help them understand the cloud native ecosystem. We do this by collaborating with groups inside and outside the CNCF.

We work to engage with CNCF projects at sandbox, incubating, and graduated level to ensure effective and accurate representation within assets, as well as CNCF Technical Advisory Groups. We also provide a vendor neutral forum for validation, discussion and feedback.

Areas in scope of the working group are CNCF non-code assets such as the CNCF Landscape, the Trail Map, as well as a maturity model and landscape guide - the last two under development. Additionally any other assets that help cloud native technology adopters navigate the various CNCF and cloud native community projects.

Currently assets under development:

* The Cloud Native Maturity Model
* The CNCF Landscape Guide, in association with the CNCF Business Value Subcommittee.

## Cloud Native Maturity Model Reference Documents

The Cloud Native Maturity Model Reference documents are located in this repository in the `reference` directory. We suggest reading the [prologue](./reference/prologue.md) document first, followed by the five key reference documents:

* [People](./reference/people.md)
* [Process](./reference/process.md)  
* [Policy](./reference/policy.md)  
* [Technology](./reference/technology.md)
* [Business Outcomes](./reference/business_outcomes.md)

As these are living documents, we welcome your feed back and invite you to submit issues and pull requests.

## Come join us

Anyone interested in educating and informing users with guidance to understand the cloud native ecosystem is welcome to join the Cartografos Working Group! Above we showcase assets under development.
