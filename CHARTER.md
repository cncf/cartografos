# CNCF Cartografos Working Group Charter

## Introduction

This document describes the purpose and operations of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation [(CNCF)](cncf.io) Cartografos Working Group.  The group will work to further develop existing CNCF assets such as the CNCF Landscape, and foster new initiatives.  It will deliver assets that will increase the maturity of cloud native technology deployments for adopters and end-users, as well as help with navigating the CNCF and wider cloud native community landscape.  This is specifically intended to meet the following statement in the CNCF [Cloud Native definition](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md) *“We democratize state-of-the-art patterns to make these innovations accessible for everyone.”*

## Mission

- **Clarify and Inform** - Provide valuable and objective information to the TOC, End Users and Projects of the CNCF about areas considered in-scope. Educate and inform users with unbiased, effective, and practical information.

- **Collaborate** - Work with groups inside and outside the CNCF to progress Cartografos Working Group topics.

- **Assist CNCF projects and Technical Advisory Groups** - Engage with CNCF projects at Sandbox, Incubating and Graduated level to ensure effective and accurate representation within Cartografos assets, and ensure relevant and objective information emphasised by projects is highlighted by the Cartografos Working Group.  Work with CNCF TAGs and member projects’ SIGs to ensure relevant areas such as security, observability, architecture and storage are accurately and prominently displayed where appropriate.

- **Afford impartial stewardship** - Provide and maintain a vendor neutral forum for validation, discussion, and feedback and establish procedures to assist where necessary.

## Areas considered in Scope

CNCF non-code assets such as the CNCF Landscape, Trail Map, Maturity models and other assets that assist cloud native technology adopters navigate the various CNCF and cloud native community projects.  

We will review assets regularly and propose changes or retirement, should assets no longer meet their intended purpose. CNCF staff will be responsible for execution of any changes and will retain final control of assets.

We will propose new assets that guide adopters of cloud native technology, in line with the cloud native definition.  Assets may be specific to a project such as Kubernetes or another CNCF project, or, like the Landscape, may span the CNCF and wider cloud native ecosystem.

## Areas considered out of Scope

- The Cartografos Working Group will not be creating standards.  The group needs to take into account the CNCF’s own policies around [standards](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/03/08/introducing-the-cloud-native-landscape-2-0-interactive-edition/).

- The Cartografos Working Group will interact with other groups for knowledge sharing in a spirit of collaboration to assist in the creation of assets.  It will not participate in other groups’ decisions nor determine or provide technical direction.
