Too many maintainers think they donâ€™t need governance ... until something goes wrong. Undefined or inadequate governance results in a lack of transparency that causes confusion over how decisions are made, unrealistic expectations, and unresolved disagreements. The CNCF helps projects adopt good governance practices with a focus on fair and transparent governance from sandbox to incubating to graduated.

This talk will cover:
* Why governance is important
* Selecting an appropriate governance model
* Templates with patterns that work well to bootstrap CNCF projects
* The role of mission, values, and scope in setting expectations
* Defining roles, responsibilities, processes, and procedures within your governance model
* Contributor ladders to help people move into leadership positions
* The governance pros and cons of contributing a project to the CNCF

The audience will get practical advice about creating fair and neutral governance structures and processes for open-source projects.
