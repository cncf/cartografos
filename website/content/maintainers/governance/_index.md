This directory contains a collection of documents assembled by the Governance
subproject as advice and detailed information about project governance for CNCF
project leaders and managers.  Primarily, these documents are intended to answer
"How do I implement the governance requirements specified for a Graduated
project."

There will also be an assortment of other "good governance advice" documents for
projects just willing to improve things in general.
